This is just a simple web presence with very minimal styling. I plan to use this website as a playground to experiment with CSS away from my personal website.

I love computers and all things tech. I am 17, queer, autistic & chronically ill.  

You can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/wobblybrian.xyz), [GitHub](https://github.com/wobblybrian), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@wobblybrian), [Reddit](https://reddit.com/user/wobblybrian) and [Instagram (Private)](https://instagram.com/wobbly.brian). 

My discord username is ``wobblybrian``.
